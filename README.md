# HTML
Assignment Project in Testbook

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create web pages. HTML is responsible for the structure of a website, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and tables. Every website on the internet is built using HTML in some form.

HTML works by using tags to tell the browser how content should be displayed. These tags organize information into a readable and meaningful format. HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language, which means it describes content rather than performing logic or calculations.
